# Module2_HTML_CSS
In fact, I have a problem with this assignment. I have done some searching. But it was not solved. 
My problem is that, when I set the margin of the div (class=row), the float will not work. However, when i set the margin of the div (class=col-lg-4 col-md-6 col-sm-12), the margin will not work. In one word, the margin and float con not work at the same time.
